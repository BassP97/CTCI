The sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 less than 100 is 233168.

I arrived at this answer using the following python code:

def main():
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0,1000):
        if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
            sum = sum+i
    print(sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

One can also arrive at the correct solution by using the summation identity
(n*(n+1))/2. If we plug in 333 (the number of multiples of 3), 199(the number of
multiples of 5) and subtract the result of 66(the number of multiples of 15, or 
everything we've double counted) we arrive at 166833+99500âˆ’33165, or 233168!
